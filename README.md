# ProblemSolving
This repository contains solutions for all problems that I solved in LeetCode.LeetCode or HackerRank.Hackerrank or questions that I had in interviews. I will add new solutions when ever I solve a problem in one of these sites.

In main function all the methods are called in same sequence that they are implemented below the main function, so you can find them easy and un-comment them to see the result.
I also mentioned name of the problem at top of the methods so if you can't understand what the problem is you can search it in HackerRank.Hackerrank or LeetCode.LeetCode to see the full description of the problem.
